a typical spark/big data scenario _spark in action_:
> ingestion,
> data quality,
> transformation, and
> publication.

_ingest (raw data)_ from different data sources. you can build your data source if a format is not supported.

_data quality (pure data)_ check quality of data

_transformation (rich data)_ join data, aggregations, machine learning, ...

_load and publish (actionable data)_ like ETL load into data warehouse
